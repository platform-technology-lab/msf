[Start] 
sudo docker-compose up -d --build

If a container exists after prior building, the docker compose doesn't rebuild it. So, [--build] option is necessary.

[Stop] 
sudo docker-compose down

[Log]
If you want to see logs,
 
sudo docker-compose logs [-f] [service name]

[-f] option shows logs continuously without terminating.
